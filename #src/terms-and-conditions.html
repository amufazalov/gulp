                    Welcome to Ali Fakhrmousavi’s website. By accessing or using this website, you agree to comply with

                    The story follows a sculptor who has lost his wife and sinks into despair, only to find new hope
                    through a young Iraqi
                    refugee. At once a personal drama and an anti-war love story, the film uses intimate relationships
                    as a metaphor for the
                    devastations and renewals experienced by entire nations.
