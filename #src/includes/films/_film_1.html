      <p>Ali Fakhrmousavi's first feature-length film outside Iran, Autumn Memories was shot entirely
        in Ukraine with sequences in English. This international co-production gave the film a unique
        atmosphere and underlined its universal message.</p>
      <p>The story follows a sculptor who has lost his wife and sinks into despair, only to find new
        hope through a young Iraqi refugee. At once a personal drama and an anti-war love story, the
        film uses intimate relationships as a metaphor for the devastations and renewals experienced
        by entire nations.</p>
