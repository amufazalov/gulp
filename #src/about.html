                    television, and radio. He wrote and directed television series, TV films, documentaries, and
                    journalistic programs, while also working in online production, news, and reality formats. This
                    multidisciplinary foundation shaped the cinematic voice that later defined his feature films.

                        <p>Ali Fakhrmousavi's first feature-length film outside Iran, Autumn Memories was shot entirely
                          in Ukraine with sequences in English. This international co-production gave the film a unique
                          atmosphere and underlined its universal message.</p>
                        <p>The story follows a sculptor who has lost his wife and sinks into despair, only to find new
                          hope through a young Iraqi refugee. At once a personal drama and an anti-war love story, the
                          film uses intimate relationships as a metaphor for the devastations and renewals experienced
                          by entire nations.</p>
