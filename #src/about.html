                    Over more than two decades, Ali Fakhrmousavi has lived and worked in seven countries across Europe and Asia, gaining experience in cinema, television, and media. This diverse background allowed him to merge cultural contexts and professional practices — an approach clearly visible in his films and scripts.

                    In 2023, he relocated to Vancouver, Canada, one of the world’s leading film hubs, to continue his international career. Here, he is developing his next feature project — an English-language film, produced in collaboration with Canadian partners and currently in preparation for the 2026 festival circuit.
